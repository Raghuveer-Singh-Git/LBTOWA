# Insuring the uninsured using XRPL - LBTOWA
Agricultural communities face financial risks and threats to their livelihoods. Our solution aims to reduce financial risk posed by unpredictable weather, providing a safety net for these communities.

The lack of access to quick and reliable insurance for farmers leaves them vulnerable to climate change and its effects. Agricultural Insurance (Weather Futures): This is a form of coverage that protects farmers from financial losses caused by severe weather conditions such as high rainfall, low rainfall, and heatwaves. It provides a safety net for agricultural communities, ensuring sustainable incomes despite unpredictable weather patterns. 
Problems with Current Insurance Models: The current insurance models lack adequate coverage of the unique challenges faced by these communities and businesses. They may need to offer more coverage for the wide range of weather conditions and events that can impact these sectors. There’s a need for more robust and comprehensive insurance solutions that can provide stability and resilience in the face of these challenges.

By creating a simple UI and weather futures trading platform HxH provides the solution to these challenges.

based on index...

### Futures
- YTD
- HDD
- Direct Index based

### Bets
At the start of each month/period equal amounts of ‘above’ and ‘below’ tokens are created with the total price for 1 ‘above’, and 1 ‘below’ token being $1.01 (1 cent of which is our fee). The ‘above’ and ‘below’ tokens are initially priced based on weather forecasts, though the prices change and follow free market/AMM pricing models once trading starts.

At the end of the month/period, when the data is available the tokens evaluate to either $1 or $0 based on the weather conditions. For instance, if the average daily temperature in Singapore is above 30 °C in January 2023 then a 33 °C January 2023 Singapore ‘above’ token will payout $1 to its owner, and a corresponding ‘below’ token would payout $0 to its owner. The tokens will function similarly for average precipitation by region.
