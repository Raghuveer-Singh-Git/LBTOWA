# Insuring the uninsured using XRPL - LBTOWA
Agricultural communities face financial risks and threats to their livelihoods. Our solution aims to reduce financial risk posed by unpredictable weather, providing a safety net for these communities.

The lack of access to quick and reliable insurance for farmers leaves them vulnerable to climate change and its effects. Agricultural Insurance (Weather Futures): This is a form of coverage that protects farmers from financial losses caused by severe weather conditions such as high rainfall, low rainfall, and heatwaves. It provides a safety net for agricultural communities, ensuring sustainable incomes despite unpredictable weather patterns. 
Problems with Current Insurance Models: The current insurance models lack adequate coverage of the unique challenges faced by these communities and businesses. They may need to offer more coverage for the wide range of weather conditions and events that can impact these sectors. There’s a need for more robust and comprehensive insurance solutions that can provide stability and resilience in the face of these challenges.

By creating a simple UI and weather futures trading platform HxH provides the solution to these challenges.

* YTD
* HDD & CDD
- he concept of Heating Degree Day (HDD) and Cooling Degree Day (CDD) indices originated from observations by engineers who noted that commercial buildings often required heating to maintain an indoor temperature of 70°F when daily mean outdoor temperatures fell below 65°F. Conversely, air conditioning might be needed when temperatures rose significantly above 65°F. The mathematical expressions for HDD and CDD are as follows:

HDD = Max(0, 65°F - daily average temperature)
CDD = Max(0, daily average temperature - 65°F)

For instance, if a day's average maximum and minimum temperature is 35°F, the HDD for that day is 30, and the CDD is 0.

The original HDD and CDD futures are based on cumulative values throughout a specific month. For example, an average daily temperature of 45°F corresponds to an HDD of 20 (65°F - 45°F). If the daily average temperature exceeds 65°F, the HDD for that day is zero. A monthly contract is cash settled at the cumulative value of HDDs recorded each day of the month.

Consider a month with 31 days, where the average daily temperature is 45°F. The cumulative monthly HDD would be 620 (31 days x 20). The futures contract value is determined by multiplying this figure by $20, resulting in a contract value of $12,400 (=$20 x 620) in this example.

### Bets
At the start of each month/period equal amounts of ‘above’ and ‘below’ tokens are created with the total price for 1 ‘above’, and 1 ‘below’ token being $1.01 (1 cent of which is our fee). The ‘above’ and ‘below’ tokens are initially priced based on weather forecasts, though the prices change and follow free market/AMM pricing models once trading starts.

At the end of the month/period, when the data is available the tokens evaluate to either $1 or $0 based on the weather conditions. For instance, if the average daily temperature in Singapore is above 30 °C in January 2023 then a 33 °C January 2023 Singapore ‘above’ token will payout $1 to its owner, and a corresponding ‘below’ token would payout $0 to its owner. The tokens will function similarly for average precipitation by region.
