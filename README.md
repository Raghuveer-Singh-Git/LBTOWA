# Insuring the uninsured using XRPL - LBTOWA
Agricultural communities face financial risks and threats to their livelihoods. Our solution aims to reduce financial risk posed by unpredictable weather, providing a safety net for these communities.

The lack of access to quick and reliable insurance for farmers leaves them vulnerable to climate change and its effects. Agricultural Insurance (Weather Futures): This is a form of coverage that protects farmers from financial losses caused by severe weather conditions such as high rainfall, low rainfall, and heatwaves. It provides a safety net for agricultural communities, ensuring sustainable incomes despite unpredictable weather patterns. 
Problems with Current Insurance Models: The current insurance models lack adequate coverage of the unique challenges faced by these communities and businesses. They may need to offer more coverage for the wide range of weather conditions and events that can impact these sectors. There’s a need for more robust and comprehensive insurance solutions that can provide stability and resilience in the face of these challenges.

By creating a simple UI and weather futures trading platform HxH provides the solution to these challenges.
